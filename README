**Title: Olympic Medal Prediction Project**

**Overview**

This project explores the relationship between various factors and the number of medals a country wins at the Olympic Games. Historical Olympic data was analyzed to develop a predictive model using linear regression.

**Hypothesis**

We hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between the number of athletes representing a country, the country's previous Olympic medal count, and its predicted medal count in future Olympics.

**Dataset**

- The primary dataset used was "teams.csv". (Provide a brief description or, if it's readily available, a link to the dataset source).
- Key features considered include "athletes", "age", "prev_medals", and "medals".

**Analysis and Modeling**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data is imported and cleaned using Pandas. Visualization techniques such as Seaborn's `lmplot` and histograms were used to analyze the data, uncover patterns, and address missing values or outliers.

2. **Linear Regression Model:** A linear regression model was built using scikit-learn. The model considered "athletes" and "prev_medals" as predictors for the "medals" target variable. The model was trained on data prior to 2012 and tested on 2012 and later Olympics.

3. **Evaluation:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was the metric used to evaluate the model's performance. Error analysis was also performed at the country-level to gain insights into where the model performed well or poorly.

**Key Findings (Replace with your findings):**

- **Correlation of predictors:** [Summarize the correlations found between variables, e.g., Was there a strong positive correlation between "athletes" and "medals"?]
- **Model Performance:** [State the MAE achieved - e.g., "a MAE of 5" means the model was off by an average of 5 medals in its predictions].
- **Error Analysis:** [Discuss countries where the model did exceptionally well/poorly].

**Limitations and Future Directions**

- **Dataset size:** A larger dataset with more years and potentially with additional features could improve model accuracy.
- **Exploring more complex models:** Investigating non-linear models or tree-based models might result in better predictions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones may yield a more predictive model.

**Project Setup**

- **Dependencies:**

  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - numpy

- **Usage:**
  To replicate the analysis, access a dataset named "teams.csv" and run the provided Jupyter Notebook.
